The Bitex.la API lets you build applications that leverage Bitex exchange liquidity,
funding options, crypto asset custody, cross-border remittances and mass disbursements.

These guides show how to go through some of the use cases supported by the Bitex API.

You'll probably be going back and forth between these guides and the [API reference](https://developers.bitex.la).

We're looking to hear from you, tell us what you need and we'll add it,
pull request to this repository are also welcome. We're always reachable at developers@bitex.la.
