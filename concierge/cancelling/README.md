# Cancelling a request
  - When can a request be cancelled? Up to which state, and mention there's no cost if done quick.
  - How can it be cancelled?
  - What happens if I try to cancel afterwards? Cannot be cancelled, the balance will be deducted
    from your account. If you don't have enough funds you'll have a negative balance.
