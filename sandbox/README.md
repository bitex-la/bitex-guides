# The API Sandbox

We have a Sandbox environment at [https://sandbox.bitex.la](https://sandbox.bitex.la).

You should always start your API integration in the Sandbox before moving to Production.

Sandbox and Production behave very similar, but share no data. You'll have to sign up
to each one of them separately. Learn more in the [Authentication Guide](/bitex-guides/authentication)

The Sandbox uses the BTC and BCH testnets, so you can deposit testnet coins from a
[Bitcoin Testnet Faucet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/) or a 
[Bitcoin Cash Testnet Faucet](https://developer.bitcoin.com/faucets/bch/).

You can even also do some trading in the Sandbox exchange, just don't expect the prices to match real market prices.

Feel free to contact the developer team at [developers@bitex.la](mailto:developers@bitex.la)
for any administrative task in the Sandbox, such as:
- Requesting for an account to be approved (or rejected).
- Resetting a 2FA.
- Crediting fiat deposits.
- Processing fiat or crypto withdrawals.
- Following through with a concierge request.
