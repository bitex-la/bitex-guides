# Market Watch

A good example of a Market Watch is [bitcoinaverage.com](bitcoinaverage.com), it's a website providing real-time price and trade volume data about several bitcoin exchanges, and Bitex is one of them.

They get our market summary from the [Market](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#669ba3d8-5706-41b5-9d9c-de3a24d14e01) endpoint.

If you're building something similar you may also take a look at the Asks and Bids for market depth and [Transactions](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#fe28db2c-90dc-4b84-b09e-b4002e657ddf) for last hour traded volume, or even better, to the [Candles](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#2993b522-a465-44e9-8390-03fec1cd23f0) for the aggregated data in a format that is friendly for [candlestick charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart).
