# Trading and Arbitrage

Before you start trading or arbitraging Cryptocurrencies you should get a full view of the current market and your position using the [Transactions](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#fe28db2c-90dc-4b84-b09e-b4002e657ddf) endpoint to learn about the most recent volatility, [Market](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#669ba3d8-5706-41b5-9d9c-de3a24d14e01) to get the current market depth and [Account](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#2aede449-e351-4410-8c89-da76c053474c) to check your available balances.

Once that's done it's easy to place [Bids](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#5485d842-a27f-4871-8fce-5b5a225caf96) and [Asks](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#6f7cfbba-c247-4582-b25f-4016a5e87550) in Bitex, as well as following their execution status in your [Active Order List](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#960b4730-b86c-4d30-9311-f698c81133cc).

Or you can check your recent [Trades](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#211e05ca-e788-4239-abde-1d9bdf8d5214) to see what got bought and/or sold.

We have an open source robot that can be used as an example of our API usage, and can also be used to do arbitrage between Bitex and other exchanges. [Fork it on Github](https://github.com/bitex-la/bitex-bot).
