# Trading and Arbitrage

Before you start trading or arbitraging Cryptocurrencies you should get a full view of the current market and your position using the [Transactions](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#1f20a86d-8588-4f3f-832d-1db00f12ff77) endpoint to learn about the most recent volatility, [Market](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#53957d37-2304-4427-bc0b-c9321e34254f) to get the current market depth and [Account](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#2aede449-e351-4410-8c89-da76c053474c) to check your available balances.

Once that's done it's easy to place [Bids](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#6d5f5991-ba42-448f-9583-3b4d48e18350) and [Asks](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#892ed025-47b7-4216-a2c4-7407aa7c150e) in Bitex, as well as following their execution status in your [Active Order List](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#81d0cc59-58fa-445d-9a92-e6476bf15837).

Or you can check your recent [Trades](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#e69cec1b-6b33-4545-85aa-bcce0d8a27ec) to see what got bought and/or sold.

We have an open source robot that can be used as an example of our API usage, and can also be used to do arbitrage between Bitex and other exchanges. [Fork it on Github](https://github.com/bitex-la/bitex-bot).
