Companies providing financial services should be **all about transparency**.

Bitcoin's Blockchain taught us decentralized trustless
systems are better, but when the **need for trust cannot be avoided**, a high
degree of transparency is required.

As a CrossBorder payments platform and cryptocurrency exchange Bitex has
always had access to **privileged information** about customer balances and activities.

**We don't want that privilege**, and we believe our customers should be our first
auditors, so we're publishing detailed information to make sure that we don't
know much more than you do.

Although Bitex must be transparent, our **customer privacy is a top priority**,
therefore all the data we publish cannot be associated to
any particular customer.

Starting January 2020 we're building an incremental report several times a day with **data
we declare to be true** concerning deposits, withdrawals, transfers, trades and
crypto asset addresses known to us.

**A fingerprint** of each report is then **stored forever in the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain**,
using a custom protocol designed by Bitex to make it as straightforward as possible
for you to verify this data using widely available tools.

While blockchain attestation **does not guarantee the data to be correct**, it does
**make it evident when any data is changed afterwards**.
No change will ever go unnoticed, and any departure from the established
attestation protocol will demand an explanation.

Keep reading to learn what data we publish and how to audit it.
