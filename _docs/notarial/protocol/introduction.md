*Notarial Protocol* could be built over any cryptocurrency compatible with the Bitcoin scripting language. Specifically *Notarial* needs for OP_RETURN (`0x6a`) operation code with a capacity of at least 38 bytes. Right now *Notarial* could be implemented, over Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC), but it is not limited to them.  

Although _Notarial_ can be implemented in any of those cryptocurrency, we have chosen to use the **Bitcoin Cash** blockchain because the costs of fees are more convenient.
