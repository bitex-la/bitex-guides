# Asset Management

If you simply want to buy BTC, get the [Deposit Instructions](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#7345f816-e2db-4a29-b9d2-8c9d8e432a82) There is no need to send us the information about the deposit, once it's accredited in our bank, we will update your balances. After you get your balance updated, you can buy BTC [creating a Bid](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#5485d842-a27f-4871-8fce-5b5a225caf96) or [creating a Buying Bot](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#6db95916-fecf-4621-8e14-f0996e944a87).

If you want to buy BTC for different people, either you become a Reseller (contacting us at [comercial@bitex.la](mailto:comercial@bitex.la)) and perform the actions mentioned above on behalf of your clients, or you do it in your unique account and you handle your clients' balances by yourself.
