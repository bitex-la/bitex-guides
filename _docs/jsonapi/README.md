# The JSON-API Standard.

[JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org) is a standard format for RESTful API's in a
that allows for efficient modeling and retrieval of related resoruces.

Using JSON-API means that you can consume our API with any compatible
[JSON-API client library](https://jsonapi.org/implementations/).

We even have Bitex specific wrappers for some languages in our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/bitex-la),
that model all our API resources and relationships. We'll gladly take requests for your favourite language.

If you are unable to use a JSON-API client library, our responses can be
treated as regular JSON.
