The **CrossBorder API** let's you perform remittances and mass disbursements
between any `Users` you manage.

You can pay multiple recipients in different countries and currencies
simultaneously.

In this guide you'll learn how to issue a **CrossBorder** payouts using
a `Request`, how to set up each destination as a `RequestOutputs`,
how to get a quote, and how to receive progress updates and tracking information.

Your `Request` and each individual `RequestOutput` go through a series of states
before reaching their final destination, you'll also learn about all those states and what they mean.

Before you can start using the **CrossBorder API** you
will need a Bitex account with the [Master User Role](/docs/authentication/welcome) to
create all the `Users` that will be sending and receiving the payments.

If you're starting out your integration on **sandbox** feel free to contact
the [developers team](mailto:developers@bitex.la) to
grant you **Master** `User` access and credit funds to any `User` that needs them.
