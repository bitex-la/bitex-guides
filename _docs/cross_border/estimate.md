An `Estimate` tries to be a simpler way to get a reference quote without
having to set up a full `Request` with all the `Users` and `RequestOutputs`.

For an `Estimate` you just need to provide the origin and destination
`Ports` and either the `amount` or `budget` to be paid on each one.
You can configure m√∫ltiple ports.

Estimates are always available in real time, unlike `Requests` that are
quoted asynchronously. The main difference is that an `Estimate` is not
contractual. **Bitex does not commit to honor `Estimate` prices.**

`Estimates` are not persisted, so their ID is meaningless, but they're issued
with a `hint_token`. If you ask to quote a `Request` within 10 minutes of 
getting an estimate for the same amounts and ports, you can provide the `Estimate`'s `hint_token`
to the `request_quote` endpoint and we'll maintain the same pricing.

See the [API Reference](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#a180cbc6-95a7-44ae-bd27-0fa3c07484fe)
for more information about estimates.
