# Accept Bitcoin Payments

You can start accepting bitcoin payments using our [Merchant](https://developers.bitex.la/?version=latest#d02432d6-444c-40bb-b8bf-c12fb5fe3a90) endpoints

We can quote your customer local currency into bitcoin so you can request them to pay "100 ARS in Bitcoin".

Once you receive the Bitcoin we can convert it to USD at the best BTC/USD bitex price, or keep it as Bitcoin if you want to.

All funds will be credited to your bitex account and from there you can proceed to request a withdrawal to your own Bitcoin wallet or to your bank account.
