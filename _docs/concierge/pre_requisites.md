Before you can start using the Concierge API for cross-border remittances you 
will need a Bitex account with the [Master User Role](/docs/authentication/master_user) so that you can set up all your payees.

Also, make sure your Bitex account has funds to issue the payment.

If you need to get **Master User** status, and have funds credited to a **sandbox account**, please contact the developers team at [developers@bitex.la](mailto:developers@bitex.la).

For **production**, we can help you sign up, apply to the **Master User Role** and fund your Bitex account. Just contact a accounts representative at [comercial@bitex.la](mailto:comercial@bitex.la).
