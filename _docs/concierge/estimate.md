You can get a quick estimate for your Concierge Remittance or Mass disbursement
before you get an actual quote.

An estimate is the `amount` we will ask from you at the origin `port` in order
to produce the requested amounts at the destination `ports`.

The estimate can be calculated from the origin `port` and the total amounts to be delivered at each destination `port`.

A `Request` quote, as you'll see next, is an `amount` we're bound to honor,
but it requires you to specify each actual payee and amount among other things.
