The Bitex.la API lets you build applications that leverage Bitex exchange liquidity,
funding options, crypto asset custody, cross-border remittances and mass disbursements.

These guides will help you with your integration for any of our main use cases.

You'll probably be going back and forth between these guides and the [API reference](https://developers.bitex.la),
which is built with **Postman** and provides actionable examples.

We're looking to hear from you, tell us what you need and we'll add it,
pull request to this repository are also welcome. We're always reachable at developers@bitex.la.

Now [just go back](/), and choose your use case.
